# Unit conversions through graph search
Resolves conversion problems through the generation of a graph of relationships, and then travels through the graph to calculate the conversion factor. It works using explicit units.

It is a collecion of functions to be able to handle explicit units in variables.

# Graph solution finding
The solution is found by performing a BFS search algorithm
